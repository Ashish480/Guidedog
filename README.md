Project Description
Guide Dog in the Supermarket:

Ever dreamed of having a guide dog navigate the aisles of a supermarket for you? Probably not, but here we are! Our project, in all its quirky glory, introduces a virtual guide dog in a simulated supermarket, ready to assist you in locating products‚Äîeven the ones you weren‚Äôt looking for.
The Problem (That Doesn‚Äôt Really Exist)

Imagine this: you‚Äôre lost in a supermarket, searching for that elusive jar of peanut butter you forgot you needed. Sure, you could ask a human‚Äîbut wouldn‚Äôt it be cooler if a virtual guide dog was there to assist?
The Solution (Nobody Really Asked For)

Introducing‚Ä¶ Supermarket Guide Dog 3000! Leveraging ROS 2 and Gazebo simulations, our virtual canine will navigate the supermarket and "guide" you to products with a blend of enthusiasm and randomness. Yes, it might just lead you to the shampoo section instead of the cereal aisle.
Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used

For Software:

    Languages: Python, C++
    Frameworks: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
    Libraries: OpenCV (for item detection), Machine Learning for object recognition
    Tools: RViz (for visualization), Gazebo (for simulation), Python scripts for navigation

For Hardware (Simulated):

    Simulated Components: Robotic sensors, motors for virtual ‚Äúdog‚Äù movement
    Specifications: Designed for navigating supermarket aisles with charm
    Requirements: A computer with ROS 2, Gazebo installed, patience, and a sense of humor.

Implementation

For Software:

    Simulation Setup: We created a supermarket environment in Gazebo for the guide dog‚Äôs adventures.
    Guide Dog Navigation: The virtual dog roams the aisles using ROS 2 nodes for pathfinding and avoiding ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù (obstacles).
    Detection and Guidance: Machine learning algorithms recognize certain items and steer the guide dog toward them‚Äîeven if they weren‚Äôt requested.
    Visualization in RViz: Watch our guide dog‚Äôs journey unfold in RViz for a play-by-play experience.

For Hardware (Simulated):

    Sensors & Actuators: Virtual sensors enable movement, obstacle avoidance, and item detection.
    Dog Model: An adorable dog avatar, because every guide dog must be cute.

Installation

    Clone the Project:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/TominMichael/guidedog.git
cd guidedog

Install Dependencies:

bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-desktop  # or appropriate ROS 2 version

Run Setup Scripts (inside the repository):

bash

    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash  # or your installed ROS version
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash

Running the Simulation

    Launch Gazebo World:

    bash

ros2 launch guidedog supermarket_world.launch.py

Start Guide Dog Node:

bash

ros2 run guidedog guide_dog_node

Launch RViz for Visualization:

bash

    ros2 launch guidedog rviz_view.launch.py
