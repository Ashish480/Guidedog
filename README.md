Project Description

Guide Dog in the Supermarket:
Have you ever wished you had a guide dog that could navigate you through the aisles of a supermarket? Probably not, but we‚Äôre here to solve that non-existent problem anyway! Our innovative (but maybe pointless) project brings a virtual guide dog to life in a simulated supermarket, ready to lead you to products you may or may not be looking for!
The Problem (That Doesn‚Äôt Really Exist)

Imagine walking through the maze of a supermarket, hopelessly lost, looking for that jar of peanut butter you probably forgot you needed. Sure, you could ask a human, but wouldn‚Äôt it be way cooler if you had a virtual guide dog to do the job instead?
The Solution (Nobody Really Asked For)

Introducing... Supermarket Guide Dog 3000! Using cutting-edge ROS 2 and Gazebo simulations, our virtual canine companion will navigate the supermarket, helping (or distracting) you on your shopping journey. And yes, it might just show you the way to the shampoo section even if you didn‚Äôt ask for it.
Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

    Languages: Python, C++
    Frameworks: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
    Libraries: OpenCV (for item detection), ML algorithms for object recognition
    Tools: RViz (for visualization), Gazebo (for simulation), Python scripts for navigation

For Hardware:

    (Simulated only, so no actual hardware required!)
    Simulated Components: Robotic sensors, motors for ‚Äúdog‚Äù movement
    Specifications: Designed to roam the supermarket aisles with unmatched enthusiasm!
    Tools Required: A computer with ROS 2 and Gazebo installed, patience, and a sense of humor.

Implementation
For Software:

    Simulation Setup: Using Gazebo, we‚Äôve created a miniature supermarket world.
    Guide Dog Navigation: The virtual guide dog roams the aisles, using ROS 2 nodes for basic pathfinding and avoiding ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù (aka obstacles).
    Detection and Guidance: Employing a splash of machine learning to recognize certain items and steer toward them‚Äîwhether or not you asked for them.
    Visualization in RViz: For those who want a play-by-play of our dog's journey, RViz offers a full visualization experience.

For Hardware (Simulated Only):

    Sensors & Actuators: Virtual sensors are used for movement, obstacle avoidance, and item detection.
    Dog Model: A friendly dog avatar, because a guide dog must be adorable.
